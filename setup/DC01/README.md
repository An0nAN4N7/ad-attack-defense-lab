- DNS Role: Included during ADDS promotion
- Forest Setup:
  ```powershell
  Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "corp.local"

## Verification Commands

# View domain name
(Get-ADDomain).DNSRoot
corp.local


# View forest root domain
(Get-ADForest).RootDomain
corp.local


# Confirm domain controller hostname
(Get-ADDomainController).Name
WIN-B70D89CFCNG
# Confirm DNS is working
Resolve-DnsName corp.local

## Notes


- DC01 acts as the first and only Domain Controller in the `corp.local` forest
- This server also handles internal DNS for the AD environment
- Other clients (WIN10, Kali) will point their DNS to `192.168.10.10` to resolve AD services
- This machine will later host AD users, groups, OUs, and be the target for attack scenarios
- SafeModeAdminPassword was configured during `Install-ADDSForest`
- AD Tools (like `Active Directory Users and Computers`) are installed with `-IncludeManagementTools`
